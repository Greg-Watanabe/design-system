# CHANGELOG for ds-base-css
`ds-base-css`
# 1.0.2
* Updated typography.scss with new updated font sizes, added new figcaption styles, updated color scheme files with latest color values

# 1.0.1
* Removed .header-container selector from page.scss that was giving 15px padding on each side because header container doesn't need paddings since those paddings are applied individually in branding, menu and statewide-header components.
