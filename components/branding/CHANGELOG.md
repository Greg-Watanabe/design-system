# CHANGELOG for ds-branding
`ds-branding`
# 1.0.2
* Added 15px padding in mobile to the .branding selector (that padding property used to be applied to the entire header container in the base-css). Also, added menu hamburger styles (moved them from the menu component). Fixed hamburger icon colors and width properties.
