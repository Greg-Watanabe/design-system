# CHANGELOG for ds-statewide-header
`ds-statewide-header`
# 1.0.5
* Removed -15px padding left from the .official-header selector since we we don't need that padding anymore because we removed header-container with its padding properties from the base css.
# 1.0.6
* Renamed .ofiicial-logo to .official-logo. Should help prevent naming conflicts within existing markup.
