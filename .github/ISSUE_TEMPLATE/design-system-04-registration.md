# Component Registration

To help minimize the need to rename a project and cause code breakages and confusion, we take some time to choose a clear name that makes sense.

Our design system uses package control systems, and these systems need names and some basic metadata about the component.

## Component Metadata Checklist
- [ ] Component name
- [ ] Short name
- [ ] Version number
- [ ] Destination
- [ ] Description

## Naming tips
* You will probably start with a working name for a project reflecting an internal name.
* Name will be all lowercase letters, with dash separation on word breaks.
* No abbreviations
* Under 32 characters
* Get some basic user feedbac: Go over the names with team members from different roles and make sure the name makes sense to everyone.
* Pay attention to how you use the name in conversations.
* Try to keep the name easy to say and discuss.

## Description writing tips
We have found this format useful to creating a meaningful description of the component.
* What is it?
* What does it help you do?
* Where does it appear?
* How should you use it?

### Name of component
*What should we call this component in the design system? The name originally proposed might not follow our naming conventions, or may have a conflict.*

### Machine name
*What should the computer call this component? (alpha-numeric characters, dash separated, e.g. "highlight-box")* 

### Current version number

### What type of component is this?
